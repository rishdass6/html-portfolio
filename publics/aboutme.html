        <p>
        This website was created to show off the projects I have learned so far while taking this amazing course (glazing).
        Not only am I learning so much about myself through the process of coding in HTML, I am also having tons of fun 
        along the way! I hope this continues on as I start learning how to make my own websites online and as I learn CSS
        and Javascript.
